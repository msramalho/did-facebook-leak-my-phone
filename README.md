# Check if Facebook leaked your phone

(Portugal only for now, PRs welcome for other languages (check data_parsing), [data leak archive](https://archive.md/MZqak))

Head over to the [web page](https://msramalho.github.io/did-facebook-leak-my-phone/)


> NOTE ON PRIVACY: no phone number is available here (using sha256 hashes) but names are, so if you want your removed, just open an issue or contact me in any form. The tool only works from phone number to name, not the other way around (of course bad people can still use the original leak while it lives) this follows the [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) principle.
